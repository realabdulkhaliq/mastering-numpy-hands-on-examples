NumPy is a Python library.

NumPy is used for working with arrays.

NumPy is short for "Numerical Python".

It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
